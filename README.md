# Linked List implementation in pure JavaScript

Linked lists are similar to arrays since they both store collections of data. But they both differ in the way they are stored in memory.

Arrays are allocated in memory contiguously, meaning right next to each other. The problem with that is that if we want to add a new element to the array, we need to allocate a new chunk of memory for the new lenght of the array.

One way to fix this is to allocate larger than needed
